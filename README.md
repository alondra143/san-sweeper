# <h1 align="center">SAN-SWEEPER</h1>
## Background Info
As a kid when I didn't have Internet access but was allowed to play on the computer, Minesweeper was my go-to game. I didn't know the exact rules on how to play it, but I knew that I could randomly click on the tiles and keep going until I happened across a bomb, and would have fun trying my best to go as far as I could.

For this project, I wanted to capture that nostalgic aspect of Minesweeper as a beginner project with the aspiration of developing it into the real deal, and what better way to indulge in that by grabbing inspiration from Sanrio? (No copyright intended)

## Getting Started:
<img src="https://cdn130.picsart.com/241652462013212.png?type=webp&to=min&r=640" alt text="sanrio my melody and kuromi characters" align="center" width="200">

Meet My Melody and Kuromi, two best friends who love to play tricks on each other. Today, Kuromi decided to test My Melody by planting a few mines to see if My Melody is able to play without setting any of them off.

Help My Melody through the board by clicking on a tile. 
> <span style="color:pink">If it's pink, you're safe and can continue on ahead. If you're able to help My Melody get to 5 safe tiles, you'll win!</span> 

> <span style="color:purple">But once you've clicked on a purple tile, all of Kuromi's mines will explode and you'll have to try your luck again!</span> 

Click on the "watch your step" button to get started and see if you can outwit the trickster of the day.

## Next Steps (Icebox):
In the near future I want to be able to incorporate recursive functions in order to help the player avoid the mines by detecting any nearby the tile they've clicked, and/or how many safe tiles/mines are remaining on the board after each turn.

It would also be interesting to enhance the project with levels by expanding the board, the amount of mines, how many safe tiles it takes to win, and possibly setting a timer per board. The personalization of the game could continue to develop by assigning a Sanrio character to each level, and coordinating the color scheme of the board/userface to each one. 

This would give the game a fresh advancement for the user both visually and through the gameplay.
