# SAN-SWEEPER
## Background Info



As a child when I didn't have Internet access but was allowed to play on the computer, Minesweeper was my go-to game. I didn't know the exact rules on how to play it, but I knew that I could randomly click on the tiles and keep going until I happened across a mine, and would have fun trying my best as much as I could.

For this project, I wanted to capture that nostalgic aspect of Minesweeper as a beginner project with the aspects of developing it into the real deal, and what better way to indulge in that by grabbing inspiration from Sanrio?

## Getting Started:

Meet My Melody and Kuromi, two best friends who love to play tricks on each other. Today, Kuromi seems to have planted a couple of mines and wants to see if My Melody is able to beat her by avoiding them.

Help My Melody through the board by clicking on a tile. 
> <span style="color:pink">If it's pink, you're safe and can continue on ahead. If you're able to help My Melody get to 5 safe tiles, you'll win!</span> 

> <span style="color:purple">But once you've clicked on a purple tile, all of Kuromi's mines will explode and you'll have to try your luck again!</span> 

Click "watch your step" to get started and see if you can beat the trickster of the day.

## Next Steps (Icebox):
In the near future I want to be able to incorporate recursive functions in order to help the player avoid the mines by detecting any nearby the tile they've clicked, and/or how many safe tiles/mines are remaining on the board after each turn.

It would also be interesting to enhance the project with levels by expanding the board, the amount of mines, and possible setting a timer per board. The personalization of the game could continue by assigning a Sanrio character to each level, and coordinating the color scheme of the board/userface to each one. 

This would give the game a fresh advancement for the user both visually and through the gameplay.
